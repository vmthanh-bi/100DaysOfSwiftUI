## The Process

### 19 Projects
Each numbered project is taught by Paul Hudson through his videos, readings and quizes, as he slowly works through increasingly complex topics. 
The projects are ultimately prompted with challenges left up to the students to elevate the code on their own. These challenges are optional,
but I find them to be one of the most essential parts to learning and gaining the most out of this course.

### 6 Milestone projects
After 3 regular projects comes a milestone project - a project cumulating the topics of the previous 3. What puts these milestone projects above 
the regular ones is the absence of any learning material as the students are only provided with prompts to complete and a couple of hints.
I believe this to be the most challenging aspect to this course, but also the most effective as it forces the students to delve deeply into
all the previous material as well as develop our creativity to successfully tackle every problem. It is entirely up to the students to interpret
the essence of each project and find ways to fulfill that image - these milestone projects do not have a single way being done and that is where
every student can shine on their own.

### 1 Final exam
This course has a final goal that can be reached after conquering all of the aforementioned projects: an exam for all the 100 days spent. If passed,
the student obtains a certificate - with merit if they score 80% or more and with distinction if they score 95% or more. Achieving such a feat is 
without a doubt not easy and is definitely a great way to comemorate all of this hard work.
