## The Process

### 19 Projects
Each numbered project is taught by Paul Hudson through his videos, readings and quizes, as he slowly works through increasingly complex topics. 
The projects are ultimately prompted with challenges left up to the students to elevate the code on their own. These challenges are optional,
but I find them to be one of the most essential parts to learning and gaining the most out of this course.

### 6 Milestone projects
After 3 regular projects comes a milestone project - a project cumulating the topics of the previous 3. What puts these milestone projects above 
the regular ones is the absence of any learning material as the students are only provided with prompts to complete and a couple of hints.
I believe this to be the most challenging aspect to this course, but also the most effective as it forces the students to delve deeply into
all the previous material as well as develop our creativity to successfully tackle every problem. It is entirely up to the students to interpret
the essence of each project and find ways to fulfill that image - these milestone projects do not have a single way being done and that is where
every student can shine on their own.

### 1 Final exam
This course has a final goal that can be reached after conquering all of the aforementioned projects: an exam for all the 100 days spent. If passed,
the student obtains a certificate - with merit if they score 80% or more and with distinction if they score 95% or more. Achieving such a feat is 
without a doubt not easy and is definitely a great way to comemorate all of this hard work.

## The Course

### Days 1 - 14: Introduction to Swift
The first 14 days provided a gentle warm up for my SwiftUI learning as I covered the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. I worked through a selection of tutorials every day, and there was some optional extra reading afterwards I got to read through to dig even deeper.

### Day 15: Consolidation I
I just learned a lot about Swift in only 14 days, so before I continue it's important I reflect on what you've learned so far.

### Days 16 - 24: Starting SwiftUI
Now that I‚Äôve mastered the basics of Swift, in these days I‚Äôll start building real SwiftUI apps using what I learned.

- [Project 1](Project%201%20-%20WeSplit) - *WeSplit*

- [Challenge: Volume Converter](Challenge%20Day%20-%20VolumeConverter) - *ChallengeDay: VolumeConverter*

- [Project 2](Project%202%20-%20GuessTheFlag) - *GuessTheFlag*

- [Project 3](Project%203%20-%20ViewsAndModifiers) - *Views and Modifiers*


### Day 25: Consolidation II

Reviewing what I‚Äôve learned from days 16 - 24, and creating a project on these topics.

- [Milestone Project 1-3](Milestone%20Project%201%20-%20BrainTrain) - *Brain Train*


### Days 26 - 34: Expanding your skills

In these next three projects, I developed my SwiftUI skills in new directions, while also practicing the fundamentals.

- [Project 4](Project%204%20-%20BetterRest) - *BetterRest*

- [Project 5](Project%205%20-%20WordScramble) - *WordScramble*

- [Project 6](Project%206%20-%20Animations) - *Animations*


### Day 35: Consolidation III

Reviewing what I‚Äôve learned from days 26 - 34, and creating a project covering these topics.

- [Milestone Project 4-6](Milestone%20Project%202%20-%20EduTainment) - *EduTainment*


### Days 36 - 46: Scaling up to bigger apps

Now that my core SwiftUI skills are strong, I pushed past the basics and started building bigger apps.

- [Project 7](Project%207%20-%20iExpense) - *iExpense*

- [Project 8](Project%208%20-%20Moonshot) - *MoonShot*

- [Project 9](Project%209%20-%20Drawing) - *Drawing*


### Days 47 - 48: Consolidation IV

Reviewing what I have learned from days 36 - 46, and creating a project covering these topics.

- [Milestone Project 7-9](Milestone%20Project%203%20-%20Habits) - *Habits*


### Days 49 - 59: Focus on data

In these projects, I started looking more carefully at how to send, retrieve, and store data in SwiftUI apps.

- [Project 10](Project%2010%20-%20CupcakeCorner) - *CupcakeCorner*

- [Project 11](Project%2011%20-%20Bookworm) - *Bookworm*

- [Project 12](Project%2012%20-%20CoreDataProject) - *Core Data Project*


### Days 60 - 61: Consolidation V

Reviewing what I have learned from days 49 - 59, and creating a project covering these topics.

- [Milestone Project 10-12](MilestoneProject10-12) - *Users List app*


### Days 62 - 76: Views and view controllers

In these projects, the difficulty started to ramp up as I learned how to integrate code from frameworks outside of SwiftUI, including UIKit and MapKit.

- [Project 13](Project%2013%20-%20Instafilter) - *Instafilter*

- [Project 14](Project%2014%20-%20BucketList) - *BucketList*

- [Project 15](Project%2015%20-%20Accessibility) - *Accessibility*


### Days 77 - 78: Consolidation VI

Reviewing what I have learned from days 62 - 76, and creating a project covering these topics.

- [Milestone Project 13-15](Milestone%20Project%205%20-%20NameReminder) - *NameReminder*


### Days 79 - 94: Controlling UI flow

In these projects, I built my biggest apps yet, while also exploring more ways to let the user interact with my apps: tab bars, gestures, haptics, and more.

- [Project 16](Project%2016%20-%20HotProspects) - *HotProspects*

- [Project 17](Project%2017%20-%20Flashzilla) - *Flashzilla*

- [Project 18](Project%2018%20-%20LayoutAndGeometry) - *Layout and Geometry*

### Days 95: Consolidation VII
As I approach the end of our 100 days, it‚Äôs time to pause and reflect on the massive projects I‚Äôve built, then take on a fresh app building challenge.

- [Milestone Project 16-18](Milestone%20Project%206%20-%20DiceRoller) - *DiceRoller*


### Days 96 - 99: One last project
In this final project, I cover some last tips and techniques to help me build fuller apps, including how to optimize for iPad.

- [Project 19](Project%2019%20-%20SnowSeeker) - *SnowSeeker*

## Special thanks

### Thank you for taking your time to see all that I've learned about SwiftUI. 

This entire process has been long and challenging while also being extremely insightful and interesting. I want to give my thanks to Paul Hudson for creating this course that has made it so much easier to learn and understand the beauty and nuances that come with the exciting language of SwiftUI. Not only did I gain more knowledge in SwiftUI itself, I also learned more about the time, effort and patience that comes with building more intricate and complex apps. Now more than ever, I feel most complete as an iOS developer. I am proud to have achieved as much as I did and will be sure to use all this knowledge to keep improving and coming out with amazing apps!
